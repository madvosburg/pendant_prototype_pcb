Led a project to develop an RS-485 communication system for a pendant remote control as part of the Jay partner pendant development project at Conductix-Wampfler. The project aimed to create a wired version of the Jay Radio system, utilizing STM32 microcontrollers in a master-slave configuration. Key responsibilities included designing and implementing the embedded system, selecting appropriate transceivers, and developing both hardware and software components. The project culminated in the design and testing of a custom PCB.

In addition to developing the software, a hardware model of a small-scale pendant remote was created. Using Altium, a four-button pendant prototype with hardware debouncing (RC circuit with 10uF capacitors and 10k resistors) and specific GPIO headers to support the STM32 was designed. After manufacturing, each part was soldered onto this PCB, and then it was added to the project.
